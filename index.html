             In recent years, there islot of change in usage of vehicles which is becoming a
             challenge for transportation system. When predefined time is allocated at every
             road crossings  which  results  in traffic  congestion  and  becomes  uncontrollable in
             peak traffic hours,which results the waiting at traffic junctions. To  resolve the
             traffic congestion  by  construction  of  roads,  improving  the  road infrastructure by
             construction of  flyovers,  bridges.However  construction  of  roads  in urban areas is
             impossible because of limited land resources. So, in recent years traffic congestion
             problem  has  solution  by using  of  enabling  technologies  like  Internet  of Things (IOT).</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">In urban areas, as the growth of the population increases traffic becomes congested. In recent years there is an increase in usage of road vehicles and traffic also increased which is becoming a challenge for transportation system. In Present traffic system, it is not based on the traffic congestion level and a predefined time is allocated for traffic lights at every road crossing, which results in traffic congestion which causes the waiting at traffic junctions.
                This traffic congestion causes noise and air pollution. Moreover, it also causes fuel consumption. To overcome the above problem, the proposed system has the development of a congestion level-based traffic management system using IoT. It regulates the traffic light duration based on the real-time congestion level of the traffic measured at the road crossings by using ultrasonic sensors. The above <i>Fig1</i> shows our Project Kit.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px; color:black">The block diagram of the traffic congestion controlling and management system <br>using  IOT  is  shown  in figure 3.1.The  components  used  in  the  traffic congestion<br> controlling and management system  using  IOT  are  Raspberry  pi  3B+,  ultrasonic <br>sensor, LCD display.
                    <br><br>So by using this it is possible to control congestion level traffic management 
                    using <br>IOT. Traffic situation is stored on the cloud in terms of congestion levels at four<br> 
                    routes. This is further used for traffic management for improving of traffic. Finally<br>
                    real-time implementation of traffic management is developed.</p>
